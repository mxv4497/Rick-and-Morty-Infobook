# Rick-and-Morty-Infobook
Final ISTE.454.700 - MobileApplicationDevelopmentI individual project 

The application consists of two parts: main application and a widget.
The main application has some functionalities such as view characters, locations and episodes from a known cartoon - Rick and Morty. 
The data is parsed from the rick and morty api which is found here: https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/. Favoriting the characters is also available in the application, and favorited characters can be found at the Favorite section. If by any chance the favorite section is empty, it will say that it is, and with the text, a button can be found that references to the Characters section. 
The widget, gets a random character, and displays a random information regarding that character(available options are: gender, specie, specie-type, number of episodes the character starred in). Widget serves as a "Did you know?" trivia information about the characters. (more hardcore Rick and Morty-watchers might know every information by now). The information within the widget refreshes every 5 minutes.
